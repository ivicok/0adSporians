# 0adSporians


The mod has started as an exploration of 0 AD engine's capabilities, without much care for the original game's setting and historicity, adding the faction of Sporians.

The Sporian faction is loosely based on early medieval Sclaveni, so to call it a "civilization" would be misleading, as they were considered a prototypical barbarian tribe, with all the stereotypes (cf. Curta 2004), the name "Sporoi" itself coming from Procopius. The idea crystallized while reading on the menace of "Sclavonian Scythians" (Leake 1814) as a supposed cause for the emergence of Balkan Sprachbund. The language tries to be close to the reconstructed Proto-Slavic of Georg Holzer (2011) - from the perspective of diachronic linguistics, each form should be considered with an "*", they are left unaccented (for obvious reasons), and slightly adjusted towards Lithuanian orthography. 

- Houses: can be used to heal garrisoned units from the beginning.

- Gender: most units have both male and female variants. This has some historical basis for Sclaveni (e.g. in Patriarch Nicephorus' account of siege of Constantinople in 626). Male variants deal slightly more damage, female units have a higher resistance. The gender is randomly generated before the training.

- Shaman: heals only a meager amount, enough only to make an idol stay. They serve as drop-off points for skulls and provide auras for nearby melee units. With an idol of Peraunu, the aura raises their attack damage and moving speed. With an idol if Welinˀsu, they recover a small amount of dealt damage from enemy units. Think of dreadlords from Warcraft III.

- Idols: central building of the tribe's cult devoted to Peraunu or Welinˀsu (for now). Only one idol can be built, because the two gods do not like each other very much (idols of Perunъ and Velesъ were kept separated, e.g. in pagan Kiev, as mentioned in Primary Chronicle). They provide a bonus (Peraunu to attack power, Welinˀsu to regeneration), serve as a drop-off points for skulls, and fall appart in time, unless maintained by a Shaman or workers. Protect the idol well: if lost, you will not be allowed to build a second one.

- Sacrifices: fallen enemies sometimes leave an intact skull behind; of course, not very often, as axes are the weapon of choice. Skulls can be collected and brought to the idol or shamans, and then processed into ritual vessels of libation or jewelry for *wulxwāˀ-s. This acts as a resource, which can be used for unit upgrades and magic.

- Totemic Upgrades: most units can be upgraded to totemic variants according to the god, to whom a shrine is built. Peraunu, as a god of war, enables advanced tactics and technologies like horse archery. Welinˀsu, being a god of underworld, provides poison arrows.

- Swimming: light infantry units can traverse water at a reduced speed. Swimming units can carry resources and may enter or exit ships. They can also use melee attacks, but not fire bows or throw javelins.

- Winter Variants: most units use different clothes in warm and cold environment.



- Sporian Unit List

Children (PSl *jauˀnāku/*dēˀwāˀ)
- While not grown and trained enough to join the warband on their exploits, children can provide a helping hand in basic works of the tribe, like gathering food and skulls. However, they are less effective in hard work like lumbering and mining.

Warrior (PSl *wāiˀnu/*artinīˀkāˀ)
- Basic light infantry. Young tribesmen and -women eager to prove their bravery. Protected only by small shields (and, as some believe, by tattoos of totemic beasts which some of them boast on the skin), and carrying makeshift weapons, they cannot last long in a pitched battle. On the other hand, they can swim, as well as fulfill any work.
- Peraunu upgrade: rhomphaias, adding bonus hack damage
-- fluff: Thracians likely did not live enough to meet Sclaveni, but the word has been borrowed into Slavic dialects of Albania and Bulgaria with the meaning 'thunder'
- Welinˀsu upgrade: javelins, adding a ranged attack
-- a common weapon among historical Sclaveni

Hunter (PSl *lawiku/*lawikūnjāˀ)
- Ranged infantry. Accustomed to life in forests, some warriors specialize in archery, thus capable of providing ranged support. They are still very mobile, but they carry no shields for protection, being thus vulnerable to all kinds of damage. They also can swim and be used as workers.
- Peraunu upgrade: magical arrows dealing splash damage
-- Vedic "Astra" arrows have, of course, nothing with Slavic folklore
- Welinˀsu upgrade: poison arrows
-- mentioned by Mauricius in Strategikon

Raider (PSl *nājāˀddinīku/*nājāˀddinīka)
- Light cavalry. Having less horses and light weapons, tribes of the forest sometimes send mounted warriors for scouting or raiding unprotected traders and settlements. But on the open steppe, they become a formidable combat force thanks to their unmatched mobility.
- Peraunu upgrade: horse archery, with the capability to shoot while moving
-- not common among Sclaveni, but possibly practiced by Antes, considered a Slavic tribe with an Iranian elite, as well as Croats, which was possibly a genericum for a subgroup of Avars
- Welinˀsu upgrade: a giant aurochs mount, with a bonus to crush damage
-- even if Nicephorus mentions "Tauroscythians" as one of the groups of Sclaveni during the siege of 626, of course, Sclaveni did not ride the wild bull; it was, however, associated with the god and it seems to be an appropriate siege unit

Champion (PSl *wīˀtingu/*xarˀbrīˀkāˀ )
- Heavy infantry. Stronger warlords establish professional retinues, trained to fight in a close rank and well-equipped by spears, swords, and heavy shields. Unlike most other units, they also wear armor - usually imported or looted, but still greatly increasing their survivability.
- Peraunu upgrade: (something more mundane, like a magical axe or whatever)
- Welinˀsu upgrade: a dragon

Shaman (PSl *džiriku/*wulxwāˀ)
- Support unit. Preserves the cult of gods and other spirits around the tribe. Healing powers are not so powerful, but enough to stop decay of an idol. Furthermore, Shamans can serve as a drop-off point for collected skulls. Only one can be built at time.
- Peraunu abilities: the Shaman receives a powerful magical attack, effective against buildings. Gives an aura to melee units improving their damage output.
- Welinˀsu abilities: the Shaman can summon beasts from wolves up to mighty aurochs. Gives an aura to melee units to drain life power itself from the enemies they hit.

Monoxylon Boat (PSl *aldijāˀ)
- Basic monoxylon - a dugout canoe made of a single trunk of a tree. Can be used as a fishing boat or to transport up to 4 infantry units. Melee units help with rowing, increasing the boat speed. Ranged units make the boat slower, but they can fire from the board. 

Raft (PSl *parˀmi)
- The raft can be used to trade between the ports. It is cheaper than usual merchant ships, but also much slower, and it cannot transport other units. However, it can be used as a mobile drop-off point for resources.

Sailing ship (PSl *karāˀbu)
- Heaviest Sporian ship is slightly stronger than bireme, but weaker than trireme, it is also slower. It can carry max. of 15 units.
